## Software setup for solar simulator

Hardware: Newport LSH-7320 + Keithly 2401 + Labjack U3 + Windows Laptop computer

1) Setup steps:

Install the Anaconda distribution of Python: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual 

From Anaconda.Navigator, launch a cmd.exe terminal.

From the terminal command line:

pip install pyvisa
pip install labjackpython

It may not be necessary to install the KUSB-488B driver, since it is already installed on this computer.
If you plan to use your own computer, then you can download it from here (Windows only):
Here it is: https://www.tek.com/en/support/software/driver/4-0-0

It may be helpful to have the Keysight Connection Expert installed:

2) Prepare for running a sweep:

From Anaconda Navigator, launch the Jupyter server (Jupyter Notebook).

Locate the notebook "Solar Simulator_IV_Sweep_with_Lamp_Control_V2.ipynb". There should be a copy on the flash 
drive attached to the USB hub.


Make a copy of the notebook and move it to the folder where you can keep a personal copy. Also put a copy of
the K2401SS.py library in the folder with the notebook. It contains the python code to communicate with 
the Keithley and LabJack units.

From the Jupyter server, open the notebook.

Turn the Keithley 2401 meter on and plug the KUSB488 into the USB hub. Check the blue buttons to make sure 
that USB channel is on.

Also plug the Labjack unit into the USB hub and the FIO4 output of the Labjack to the trigger of the LSH-7320.

Plug the USB hub into this computer. Make sure each USB channel is on and the hardware devices mount. 

(a) Run the LJControlPanel application and make sure the LabJack U3 device is recognized. Consult
https://labjack.com/support/quickstart/u3  if you encounter problems.

(b) Use the Keysight Conection Expert to check that the Keithley 2401 is connected. It should show up 
as GPIB channel 24.


3) Run the script


Follow the instructions posted in the first markdown cell of the notebook. Once all the directory and file settings are 
the way you want them, it may be convenient to use the "Restart and run all" from the "Kernel" menu.

I have also written a "Monitor" script for the Timeseries multi-sweep scan. I expect to run timeseries scans for a period of 
many hours to characterize degradation.

Happy scanning!
